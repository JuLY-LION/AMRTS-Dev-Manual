		<h1>"How can I contribute?"</h1>
		<h2>Great Question!</h2>
		<p>What I really need are AMRTS Studio-eqivilent screenshots of what's in the DR2 Construction Kit. If you'd like to take those for me, crop them, and send them to me on my <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/jRguKc8">Discord</a>, that's be very helpful!</p>
		<p>That being said, if you'd like to convert a section yourself, that would be the biggest help. Let me know which so we both aren't doing the same thing. The file you create should be in .html or .htm, but .md works if you don't know HTML.</p>
