		<h1>Studio Panels</h1>
		<h2>Water Panel (3.4)</h2>
		<p>This panel is used for placing or removing water within your level.</p>
		
		<h3>How to use</h3>
		<p>Set the height that you want the water in the "height" box (use spacebar to "eyedrop" height of surrounding terrain, or SHIFT-Spacebar to eyedrop nearest water source). Define the area you wish to 'fill' with water by left click + drag on the terrain. Then click "apply".</p>
		<p>To erase water, define the area to be erased, then click "clear".</p>
		<p>It is best to make all of the water in your map at the exact same height. It won't hurt anything to make water of varying heights, but the mirror effect (water reflections) will not work properly.</p>
		
		<h3>Shallow water</h3>
		<p>Note that infantry and vehicles can travel through water if it's shallow enough. They are able to wade through water up to 2.5 units deep. For example, if your terrain was at a height of 10, your water would need to be at most 12.5 units for your army to be able to travel through it. Any higher and it becomes a barrier only choppers get through.</p>
