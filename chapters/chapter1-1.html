<h1>Setup</h1>
<h2>Studio Editor (1.1)</h2>

<p>The studio editor is the program you'll need to get access to all the mission editing tools available in the game. Let's start by getting it set up.</p>

<h3>Accessing the Editor</h3>

<p>Unlike Dark Reign 2, the Studio Editor for Army Men RTS was never made available by any means, and was left locked down within the game. But since then, the community has made it available with some magic trickery.</p>

<p>Many assets needed to be replaced from the vanilla game in order to get this unlocked editor working. This may make multiplayer compatibility impracial or completely impossible. As such, <mark>it's highly recommended you have a fresh install of the game</mark> in a seperate directory. This shouldn't be difficult if you purchased your copy through <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/army_men_rts">GOG</a>, but you may have difficulty creating a 2nd Steam install.</p>

<h3>Download instructions</h3>

<p><dsb>Step 1</dsb>: Download DavidTheTech's zip file that will unlock the editor for you. The zip includes .dll injection and the executable needed to open the editor.</p>

</div>
<p><dsb>Step 2</dsb>: Download TommyCD1's 7z file that contains all the assets required for the overhauled studio editor to perform its magic. (You might need <a target="_blank" href="https://7-zip.org">7-zip</a> to open it)</p>

		<span id="gray"> (ClanExF.com)</span>
	</span>
</div>
<p><dsb>Step 3</dsb>: If you haven't already, move both of these files to where AMRTS is installed, ensuring it's in the same directory as <dsb>amrts.exe</dsb>.</p>
<p><dsb>Step 4</dsb>: Extract <dsb>AMRTS_UTILS.zip</dsb> to the same folder you placed it in, and then do the same for <dsb>amrts_studio_files.7z</dsb>. Select "Yes to all" when it prompts you to replace already existing files.</p>
<p><span id="armygreen">And that's all!</span> The studio can be launched through the executable or through a new button at the top-right of the main menu.</p>
	
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>If you have any issues downloading the files, try downloading directly from the <a href="https://www.clanexf.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2924">ExF forum post</a>, where <dsb>amrts_studio_files.7z</dsb> is hosted. It's ultimately the same link, but requesting the download from on the forums should force it to cooperate.</p>

<p>Remember, once everything is installed, the studio can only be accessed by opening the launcher first and having "Auto Inject Studio" enabled.</p>
