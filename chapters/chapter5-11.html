		<h1>Creating a Single Player Mission</h1>
		<h2>Tips on Attack Scripts (5.11)</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>You can execute as many scripts in an objective action as you want. Make sure, however, that your AI base is producing enough units.
			<li>Try to put a few different types of units in your recruit types so they can deal with various threats.
			<li>A few small squads are better than a single big one: the squads will get recruited faster, and the base won't get clogged up with idle units.
			<li>Try to vary the directions of attack trails so they aren't predictable.
			<li>Pacing is everything. Too fast, and the mission becomes impossible; too slow and it can get boring.
			<li>Use ordinal rankings for important squad scripts to make sure they get executed.
		</ul>
		<h3>Scripting Variables</h3>
		<p>Each script has a set of variables that are required to execute that script. All scripts are kept in <mark>base.x\ai\scripts</mark>. You can look in the specific script for its required variables. It's also worth a look at some of the campaign missions for more examples. (Great Battles tend to use a computer personality over manual scripts.)</p>
