	<h1>Setup</h1>
	<h2>Studio Console (1.2)</h2>
	<p>The studio console is a developer resource used to execute studio commands within the editor. It's very helpful once you know what you're doing with it.</p>
	<h3>Accessing the console</h3>
	<p>The console was solely acessible in the editor, but with the improvements made in the most recent community version, it's now available during missions and the main menu too! Use <font id="armygreen">CTRL+ALT+F10</font> to open it, although <font id="armygreen">F10</font> in isloation will work if the studio editor is open. Any gameplay will remain paused while it's visable.</p>

	<p>Keep in mind you won't get an output for some commands. So if you typed your command and didn't receive any feedback, you probably did it right.</p>
