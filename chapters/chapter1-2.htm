	<h1>Setup</h1>
	<h2>Studio Console (1.2)</h2>
	<p>The studio console is a developer resource used to execute studio commands within the editor. It's very helpful once you know what you're doing with it.</p>
	<h3>Accessing the console</h3>
	<p>The console was solely acessible in the editor, but with the improvements made in the most recent community version, it's now available during missions and the main menu too! Use <font id="armygreen">CTRL+ALT+F10</font> to open it, although <font id="armygreen">F10</font> in isloation will work if the studio editor is open. Any gameplay will remain paused while it's visable.</p>

	<p>Keep in mind you won't get an output for some commands. So if you typed your command and didn't receive any feedback, you probably did it right.</p>
	
	<h3>Console commands</h3>
	<p><font id="armytan">Not a complete list!</font> More will be added in the future.</p>
	
	<p><b>Set team relation</b><br>
	<code>team.setrelation &lt;team1&gt; &lt;team2&gt; &lt;relation&gt;</code><br style="margin-bottom:7px;">
	<code>team.setrelationbothway &lt;team1&gt; &lt;team2&gt; &lt;relation&gt;</code><br>
	Sets a new relation between 2 teams. New teams are neutral with all others by default. See more in <a href="chapter2-2.html">chapter 2.2</a>.</p>
	
	<p><b>Add objective</b><br>
	<code>team.objectives.new &lt;team&gt; &lt;objective&gt;</code><br>
	Add a new objective for the listed team.</p>
	
	<p><b>Import heightmap</b><br>
	<code>studio.importbitmap &lt;path&gt; &lt;float&gt;</code><br>
	Imports heightmap as a .tga file into the level, overriding all previous terrain. See more in <a href="chapter4-2.html">chapter 4.2</a>.<br>
	Careful: <hili>This can NOT be undone</hili> without reverting your changes from the last save or loading a backup file.</p>
	
	<p><b>Find object</b><br>
	<code>common.debug.lookat &lt;ID&gt; </code><br>
	Find a specific object with its ID number in the level. Your camera will be repositioned to its location.</p>
