		<h1>Menu Tools</h1>
		<h2>Team Tool (2.2)</h2>
		<h2 style="color:#ff8080;">Under construction! Come back later!</h2>
		This section will explain the teams tool - used to create and edit teams - and how to use mission teams.
		<h3>Creating and editing teams</h3>
		<p>To create a new team, click "New", then give a name. (If you don't already see it, enable it in the tools menu.) To enter the setup menu for a team, double-click on the team's name.
		
		<h3>Editing a team</h3>
		The setup menu includes:

		<h3>Name</h3>
		<p>The name of the team. You should name it based on it's color or purpose if it's for great battle or special operation-type mission.</p>
		
		<h3>Color</h3>
		<p>The color of the team stored as an RGB value.<br>a<br>(multiplayer set-up overrides this)</p>
		
		<h3>Default Client</h3>
		<p>Also known as Default Team. If enabled, you'll play as this team when the mission is played.</p>
		<p>TommyCD1's patched Editor will ensure only 1 team can be set as the default client at a time. Having any other number will cause a crash when the map is played.</p>
		
		<h3>Available to Players</h3>
		<p>Determines if players should be allowed to select this team slot in a multiplayer match.</p>
		
		<h3>Show in Debriefing</h3>
		<p>Add details show this team's stats during the debriefing HasStats Display Statistics</p>
		
		<h3>Requires AI</h3>
		<p>Used if any units on the team are ever controlled by scripting. This includes the player's units if moved in a cineractive.</p>
		
		<h3>Side</h3>
		<p>Used to show if the team's army is comprised of plastic soldiers ("army") or ants. ("insect")</p>
		
		<h3>Fixed Side</h3>
		<p>Enable if team has pre-placed units. Disabling will spawn Sarge and a bulldozer in that team's starting region. FIX THIS IN 4-1</p>
		
		<h3>Storage</h3>
		<p>Determines starting plastic and electricty resources.</p>
		
		<h3>Spawn Region</h3>
		<p>Set this team's spawn region. Click the name above it to center your camera on the current section.</p>
		
		<h3>Personality</h3>
		<p>The AI configuration to use for this team when not controled by a player.</p>
		
		<h3>Camera Angle</h3>
		<p>Color: team color (multiplayer set-up overrides this)</p>
		
		<h3>Filtering</h3>
		<p>Color: team color</p>
		
		<h3>Objectives</h3>
		<p>Color: team color (multiplayer set-up overrides this)</p>
