		<h1>Studio Panels</h1>
		<h2>Objects Panel (3.2)</h2>
		<h2 style="color:#ff8080;">Under construction! Come back later!</h2>
		<p>This panel is used for placing all objects into the world. Open it with the 2 key.</p>
		<h3>Header3</h3>
		<p>The world's objects divided into categories for convenience. These are listed in the top box of the menu. Click the various categories to see all the objects you can place. Select "all assets" for a complete list of all placeable objects. Select the object you wish to place from the list. Left-click the terrain to place the object. You can manipulate the object in 3 basic ways. With the object selected:</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
			<td>Alt+Left click+Vertical drag</td><td class="r">Rotate object on the Z axis</td>
			</tr><tr>
			<td>Shift+Left Click+Vertical drag</td><td class="r">Adjust height of object</td>
			</tr><tr>
			<td>Ctrl+Left click+Vertical/Horrizontal drag</td><td class="r">Rotate object on X/Y axis</td>
			</tr><tr>
			<td>Up arrow/Down arrow</td><td class="r">Fix height to terrain beneath it without zipping</td>
			</tr><tr>
			<td>Ctrl+Down arrow</td><td class="r">Zips object to terrain, may adjust terrain to match*</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>*In many cases, the terrain may be adjusted for the object, but not all objects do this. You can see this in several objects in the sandbox boot camp levels where they areare half-burried in the sand, but they still have to zipped to prevent the player's units from walking through them.</p>
Zipping Objects
Most ambient objects you place will need to be ZIPPED. Zipping locks the object onto the cluster of cells it covers, so that units will know to avoid them when pathing. To "zip" an object to the terrain, select it and hit CTRL+DOWN ARROW. You should see the object snap into place. If you save your map with un-zipped objects, you'll get a warning window upon save. This message will contain a unique number for all un-zipped objects. To easily find the un-zipped object, bring down the console and type "common.debug.lookat X", where "X" is the object number. Your view will snap to that object.<br><br>

NOTE: Leaving un-zipped objects is not fatal. It is common to leave objects un-zipped when they are not intended to block movement or line-of-sight.<br><br>

Also, there are three buttons at the bottom of this menu:

Upgrade Buildings - Click while an upgradable building is selected. The building will be upgraded.
Edit Footprint - Edits footprints of objects (JACKNOTE: MATT SHOULD ADD THIS SECTION)
Type Names - a naming convenience. Toggles all object names to their actual config names.<br><br>

NOTE: When placing attack units (or anything that should be enemies/friends with anything else), be sure you are placing them on the correct team. When you are placing units, have the correct team highlighted in the "Team" menu (see section 3. for info on making teams). When placing ambient objects (trees, crates etc), it doesn't matter which team is selected.
