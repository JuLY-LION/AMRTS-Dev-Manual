<p>You aren't meant to be here yet! But welcome to what will soon be the unofficial Army Men RTS Developer Manual for the studio editor and game scripting. Once more progress is made, it'll contain all sorts of details on the editor <dsb>unlocked by DavidTheTech</dsb> and <dsb>overhauled by TommyCD1</dsb>. Everything you need to know for getting started and hopefully thriving in your multiplayer maps and singleplayer missions will be included, using the <font id="armytan">Dark Reign 2</font> construction kit as a base.</p>

<h3>Accessing the Editor</h3>

<p>Will add details later. Just follow <a href="https://www.clanexf.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2924">this guide</a> on the forums for now.</p>
<p>Activate the console with <font id="armygreen">CTRL+ALT+F10</font>.</p>

<h3>Sharing Your Work</h3>

<p>Go to the forums for this too. It's not like <a id="badlink" target="_blank" href="http://www.pandemicstudios.com">Pandemic Studios</a> is still around to share your projects on.</p>

<p>If you want to poke around in the progress I (JuLY.LION) have made so far in converting the DR2 info, <a href="contents.html">be my guest</a>.</p>
