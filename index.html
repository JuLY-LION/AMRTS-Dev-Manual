		<h2>Army Men RTS Developer Manual</h2>

		<p>Welcome! This is the community-made Army Men RTS Developer Manual for the studio editor and game scripting. It's still being worked on, but this guide will provide you with plenty of details on the editor <dsb>unlocked by DavidTheTech</dsb> and <dsb>overhauled by TommyCD1</dsb>. Everything you need to know for getting started and hopefully thriving in your creation of multiplayer maps and singleplayer missions will be included, using the <font id="armytan">Dark Reign 2</font> construction kit as a base.</p>

		<h3>Accessing the Editor</h3>

		<p>Installing and opening the studio editor is covered in <a href="chapters/chapter1-1.htm">chapter 1.1</a>. If you get stuck, view <a target="_blank" href="https://www.clanexf.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2924">this guide</a> on the ExF Forums.</p>
		<p>Activate the console with <font id="armygreen">CTRL+ALT+F10</font>.</p>

		<h3>Sharing Your Work</h3>

		<p>Unfortunately, Army Men RTS' publisher, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic_Studios">Pandemic Studios</a>, was shut down by EA in 2009 after being bought out, and so they no longer have a website for sharing your creations. Now, the best place to share your creations is on the <a target="_blank" href="https://clanexf.com/">ExF Forums</a>.</p>
